**Background**

Motivated by the need to better navigate the data analyst job market, this project was initiated to identify top-paying roles and sought-after skills, simplifying the process for others to find optimal opportunities.

The data includes valuable insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

The primary questions I aimed to address through my SQL queries were:

What skills are necessary for these top-paying positions?

What skills are most in-demand for data analysts?

Which skills correlate with higher salaries?

What are the best skills to learn for career advancement?


**Tools Utilized**
For this comprehensive analysis of the data analyst job market, I leveraged several key tools:

**SQL**: The core tool for my analysis, enabling me to query the database and uncover important insights.

**PostgreSQL**: The database management system selected for handling job posting data.

**Visual Studio Code**: My preferred tool for database management and running SQL queries.

**Git & GitHub**: Critical for version control, collaboration, and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis.


**Analysis**
Each query in this project was designed to explore specific facets of the data analyst job market. Hereâ€™s my approach to each question:

1. Highest-Paying Data Analyst Roles
   
To determine the top-paying positions, I filtered data analyst jobs by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote opportunities. This query highlights lucrative roles in the field.

SELECT    
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;

**Insights**:

Wide Salary Range: The top 10 highest-paying data analyst roles range from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating substantial earning potential.

Diverse Employers: High salaries are offered by companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T, showing a broad interest across various industries.

Variety in Job Titles: There is significant diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within the field.

2. Skills Required for Top-Paying Roles
   
To understand the skills needed for the highest-paying jobs, I joined job postings with skills data, revealing what employers value for high-compensation positions.

WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT    
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
    
**Insights**:

SQL: Leading with a count of 8.

Python: Close behind with a count of 7.

Tableau: Highly valued, with a count of 6. Other skills like R, Snowflake, Pandas, and Excel show varying degrees of demand.


3. Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts
   
This query identified the skills most frequently requested in job postings, highlighting areas with high demand.

SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
    AND job_work_from_home = True 
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;

**Insights**:

    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = True 
GROUP BY
